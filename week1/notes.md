Why have we learned language?
1. language are use to write a application 
2. Developer write high level code in these langauge
3. Compiler and Interpeter convert high level code into machine language (0 and 1)
4. Machine language is understood by computer


Complier and Interpeter (Convert high level language into machine language)
Complied -> 1. First need to compile, then need to run
            2. Usually do not compile when there is an error in your code
            3. Example - c++ , Java, Rust, Golang
Interpreted ->  1. Usually go line by line
                2. can run partially if error come later
                3. Example - Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP


why is JS better than other?
Browser can only understande the HTML/CSS/JS(not technically true)
thanks to node.js , javascript can also be used for backend developement

JS is dynamically language 
JS is loosely typed language
JS is prototype based language
JS is single threaded language (That's why it is considered to be bad language for scalable  System)

let , var , const
let and const are block scoped
var is function scoped

Datatypes (string, number , boolean, null, undefined)

if / else statement
loop
